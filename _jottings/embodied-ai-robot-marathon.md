> "If the moon hasn't come yet, streetlights can still illuminate the windowsill, shining on the white camellia as it slowly blooms..." This song, like a gentle breeze in the deep of night in the city, inadvertently soothes countless weary hearts. It sings of ordinary people's frustrations, of the gap between ideals and reality, of finding solace in imperfection. The "moon" in the song represents that difficult-to-attain perfection in everyone's heart—whether about love, career, or inner peace.
> 
> The journey of technology is much the same. We gaze up at "embodied intelligence" as the moon laden with humanity's ultimate dream of wisdom—a truly empathetic, omnipotent companion perfectly integrated with the physical world, an ultimate creation that could completely liberate productivity or even accompany us in exploring the cosmos. It is the poetry and distant horizon promised by technology, the sea of stars that countless scientists and engineers pour their hearts into trying to reach.

However, when our gaze returns from the stars to the ground, on that special marathon track in Beijing's Yizhuang district, those machine contestants crowned with the title of "intelligent," with a mixture of astonishing perseverance and visible fragility, struggle to run yet inevitably stumble, rely on human assistance, or even fail to complete the journey—casting clear shadows of reality. These shadows remind us that the ideal "moonlight" will take time to fully illuminate the world, while the "streetlights" before us—these embodied intelligent agents that concentrate cutting-edge technology yet still appear immature, fragile, and even controversial—are, in their unique way, illuminating this path of exploration filled with both confusion and hope. **How should we understand the glow of these "streetlights" and place that long anticipation for the "bright moon"?**

# **I. If "Omnipotence" Hasn't Arrived, the "Initial Dream" Can Still Slowly Take Root**

Tracing the river of scientific thought, we find that the "initial dream" of intelligence may be more ancient than imagined. Philosophical thinking, physiological exploration, psychological insight—that "long past" has already laid the groundwork for understanding mind-body interaction and the origins of cognition. However, on the stage of modern artificial intelligence, the chapter on "embodiment" has a "brief history" full of twists and turns. **Early explorations, either immersed in the halls of symbolic logic or fascinated by the intricacies of neural networks, were like "brains in vats," skilled at strategizing in abstract worlds but often awkward when dealing with the real world**—as the Moravec paradox reveals: making computers play chess is easy, but making them perceive and act like a one-year-old child is hard. We expect an "omnipotent" entity that can handle household chores and navigate factory hazards.

Until **voices began to cry out: intelligence needs a body! It doesn't merely exist within algorithms but is generated and displayed through interaction with the environment and physical action**. This echoes **the seed Turing planted more than half a century ago—letting machines have perception and learn from experience like children**. But as reality unfolds, progress often comes "one glimpse at a time." We might marvel at a robot's exquisite skill in a specific task, yet also understand that it remains a million miles from the mythical realm of "all-powerful ability." The runners on the Yizhuang track demonstrated admirable endurance and balance, yet were limited to the relatively singular dimension of "walking," with a long way to go before truly understanding and adapting to the complex and ever-changing physical world.

Indeed, the path to "omnipotence" has never been smooth. It demands that we not only develop clever "brains" (learning and perception) but also understand **how body morphology shapes intelligence, how action influences the world and in turn shapes cognition, and how these four elements—morphology, action, perception, learning—like the symphony of life, collaborate in a dynamic perception-action loop to ultimately compose the melody of "intelligence"**.

But there's no need for disappointment. "Approaching the ideal is so difficult, yet we remain unwilling to give up"—this may be the most authentic portrait of explorers. If that universally capable "bright moon" hasn't risen yet, let's take a moment to look at these "streetlights" that are striving to grow. Each of their deep explorations in specific domains, each improvement to fundamental algorithms, each seemingly "clumsy" attempt, nurtures that "initial dream." Intelligence is not a castle in the air; it is deeply rooted in the practical interaction between body and environment. These seemingly "specialized" efforts of today may well be the indispensable soil and root system for nurturing future "general" intelligence. **No need to rush maturity—plant slowly, wait patiently for the bloom.**

# **II. If "Autonomy" Hasn't Arrived, Truth Can Still Be Discerned "Between Light and Shadow"**

We yearn for robots to possess true "autonomy," breaking free from the constraints of preset programs and the invisible strings of human remote control, becoming entities with "free will" capable of independent perception, thought, and decision-making. When we see robots in demonstration videos seemingly interacting "intuitively" with the environment and collaborating seamlessly with humans, the longing for "autonomous intelligence" is instantly ignited in our hearts. But amid this dazzling interplay of light and shadow, whispers of "bubbles" never cease. We can't help but ask: How much of this mesmerizing stage effect is a carefully designed "script"? How much of this smooth, natural interaction is the "Wizard of Oz" behind the scenes working magic? And these "perfect moments" played repeatedly, how many failed attempts were they "carefully selected" from? **As the famous "kitten experiment" by Held and Hein revealed, only individuals who actively explore their environment develop normal sensorimotor abilities, while those passively receiving the same stimuli cannot—does this suggest that many current "intelligences" that passively execute or are remotely controlled lack solid foundations?**

Indeed, in the current wave of embodied intelligence, the boundary between "demonstration intelligence" and "true autonomy" is often blurred or even deliberately confused. The pursuit of capital, market expectations, and media focus together form a massive gravitational field, tempting some demonstrations to magnify achievements and conceal shortcomings, using a "beautiful illusion" of intelligence to create sensational effects. This isn't entirely deception; sometimes it stems from the helplessness in the exploration process—true general autonomy is too difficult, so showing "possibility" along specific paths comes first. But this does bring bubble-like risks to the industry and creates biases in public perception. This is the most vigilant part of the current embodied intelligence bubble: **that displayed "intelligence" may not reflect its true, robust, generalizable capabilities.**

However, where light and shadow intersect is precisely where our vision and steadfastness are tested. If that purely autonomous "bright moon" hasn't yet shone, facing the glow of these "streetlights" before us—some real, some phantasmal—there's no need to be completely immersed, nor should we reject everything. Maintain a clear-eyed scrutiny, a patient inquiry, try to understand the preset, remote control, editing, and over-optimization that may exist behind the glamour, and discern which are solid progress and which are fragile vanity. Seeing clearly "between light and shadow" isn't to extinguish enthusiasm but to find a more robust, sustainable direction forward, avoiding stranding in illusory bubbles. This wisdom of discernment is itself part of the exploration of intelligence, a necessary path through the noise to reach reality.

# **III. If "Understanding You" Hasn't Arrived, "First Babbling" Can Still Accompany You**

**We expect robots to "understand you"—not just comprehend commands but grasp unspoken moods and perceive subtle emotions.** We hope they can be warm companions, blend into the salt and pepper of everyday life, share our joys and sorrows, truly understand the exhaustion of "catching the last empty subway," comprehend the complications of "loving deeply yet having to part, unable to clear up relationship misunderstandings." But in reality, our conversations with robots often carry the awkwardness of "translation"; their behaviors may be precise and efficient but lack the warmth of human touch; and when interacting closely with them, deep inside we might still harbor a hint of concern about safety and the unknown. We always seem to be a hard-to-articulate distance away from that intuitive "understanding."

Yes, making logically rigorous machines truly understand and respond to humans' rich, nuanced, and sometimes contradictory emotional world is almost challenging the highest dimension of "intelligence." Current robots, even equipped with the most advanced language models, "understand" more based on pattern matching and probabilistic inference rather than genuine empathy and experience. They're more like children "walking forward in confusion," earnestly mimicking human speech and behavior but inevitably appearing awkward and stiff, unable to feel the pain of "even if we meet again, I might not recognize you—dust covers my face, frost fills my hair."

But think about those nights of struggling alone in the big city, those sighs of "life's long regrets flow eastward like water"; perhaps a faint light, a gentle evening breeze, can bring momentary comfort. If that empathetic "understanding you" moon hasn't risen yet, might these robots still in their "first babbling" stage, with their limited functions, to some extent share some of life's burdens and ease some of the bewilderment when "putting down cup and chopsticks unable to eat, drawing sword looking around with confused heart"? This imperfect "companionship" might be the starting point toward future deep human-machine empathy; in its awkwardness, it contains a "gentle swaying" worth cherishing—a point of warmth in the long night.

# **IV. If "Implementation" Hasn't Arrived, the "Ecosystem Tree" Can Still Be Diligently Watered**

We long for these creations shining with the light of wisdom to quickly leave the aloof laboratories and exhibition stages, "fly into ordinary people's homes," or find their place in the vast real world of factories, fields, and hospitals, achieving large-scale "practical implementation" and turning science fiction into reality. But the reality is, "you ask when I'll return, no date is set," and the path to commercializing technology is thorny. High costs, safety and reliability issues not yet fully resolved, and that stubborn "dimensional wall" between simulation and reality all stand as formidable barriers ahead. The robots running on the Yizhuang track, while exciting, clearly reveal the enormous challenges of stable "implementation" in real, open, long-duration environments.

Indeed, the real world's complexity and "unexpectedness" far exceed laboratory settings. Technology's "value" ultimately needs to be proven by creating user value in real scenarios and forming sustainable business models. This requires crossing three thresholds: from technical feasibility to engineering reliability to commercial viability. Many current technologies have made progress on the first threshold, but still face significant challenges at the latter two, making those expecting "immediate results" feel somewhat "frustrated—approaching ideals is so difficult."

However, a large tree's vigorous growth depends not only on sunlight and rain but also on the ecosystem in which it's rooted. The widespread "implementation" of embodied intelligence similarly relies on building a healthy, open, collaborative industry and innovation ecosystem. This includes: breakthroughs in underlying chips and sensors, standardization and cost reduction of core components, improvement of operating systems and development tools, open sharing of high-quality datasets, cultivation and mobility of interdisciplinary talent, and policies that both encourage innovation and standardize development. Rather than anxiously waiting for a "hit" product to emerge, it might be better to invest more patience and resources into carefully nurturing this foundational "ecosystem tree." This requires a long-term perspective and systemic thinking.

Intelligence's prosperity needs soil; one goes fast alone but far together. If that widespread "implementation" moon hasn't arrived yet, there's no need to focus only on a few star products with fluctuating emotions. Broaden your vision, pay attention to the health and maturity of the entire ecosystem, and understand that "implementation" is a process requiring patient capital and collective effort. Every current construction of ecological infrastructure, every promotion of industry standards, every contribution to open-source communities, every attempt at cross-domain collaboration, is accumulating the deepest, most fundamental power for the embodied intelligence tree to bear abundant fruit in the future, quietly laying solid foundations for that "habitat."

# **V. If "Lightness" Hasn't Arrived, "Carrying Weight Forward" Can Still Bear Thousands of Pounds**

In our dreams, robots should be as free as the wind, as fluid as water, liberated from the heavy laws of the physical world—agile in form, swift in action, energy-abundant, and tireless. But in reality, the robots we see often carry heavy "shackles": bulky batteries limit their activity radius and endurance, drive system efficiency and power density are still improving, and high-strength materials and precision manufacturing bring costs that make it difficult to truly achieve the "lightness" we expect. This weighty "shell," doesn't it resemble the burdens we sometimes feel in life, "how heavy are six pence," pressing so that one can hardly breathe? It requires constant self-adjustment to "embrace the ordinary."

Indeed, physical laws are the most basic, unbreakable rules governing this world, setting boundaries for all material existence. Energy conservation, material properties, mechanical principles—these hardware-level "hard constraints" cannot be completely eliminated by software algorithm magic alone. Making robots truly "light" and "free" in the physical world requires breakthroughs in basic science and advances in engineering craftsmanship. **But this doesn't mean that the body is merely a burden; the shape of the body itself can participate in computation, sharing some of the "brain's" work.** Think of those passive walking robots that can stably walk on slopes without active control; they use exquisite physical design to achieve seemingly intelligent behavior. This suggests that the exploration of embodied intelligence isn't just about pursuing a powerful "brain" but also about exploring how to design a smarter "body."

But think about those deep-sea submarines and space probes built to explore the unknown; they too are bulky, precise, and expensive, yet they carry humanity's deepest curiosity and bravest spirit of exploration, expanding our cognitive boundaries to unprecedented distances. If that unrestrained, light-as-a-feather "moon" hasn't come yet, these somewhat clumsy robots that need to "carry weight forward," aren't they also carrying humanity's great dream of extending intelligence, transforming the world, and challenging limits? They may not be perfect, but every attempt to overcome gravity, maintain balance, and drive limbs, every exploration of the potential of "morphological computation," is itself a profound "dialogue" with the physical world, a magnificent poem of wisdom giving matter "agency." In this "heavy" shell lies the thousand-pound force that will drive future infinite possibilities, a testament to humanity's dissatisfaction with the status quo and courage to explore.

# **VI. If "Perfection" Hasn't Arrived, "Seeking Under the Clear Radiance" Is Also Poetry**

The ultimate vision of embodied intelligence exploration often intertwines with the ideal of artificial general intelligence (AGI)—as pure and distant as moonlight—pointing toward a realm where wisdom and capability reach "perfection" and perhaps lead human civilization into a new era. Compared to this "bright moon" hanging high in the sky, all of today's most cutting-edge technological achievements, even those robots showing amazing abilities in laboratories, seem like just dappled shadows under moonlight—they have form, but are far from the moon's perfect roundness. **Integrating morphology, action, perception, learning, and even language—components from different domains with significantly different characteristics—and achieving elegant end-to-end alignment is itself an extremely challenging task.** Does this mean our pursuit is destined to be a journey that can be glimpsed but never reached, full of "nothing can be perfect" regrets? Is it like the song says, "if perfect completeness is hardest to achieve, better to choose acceptance"?

Indeed, "humans have joys and sorrows of meeting and parting, and the moon has cloudiness, brightness, fullness, and waning"; pursuing absolute "perfection" is perhaps a deep obsession in human nature, and possibly an eternal tension in universal law. This reminds one of how Chinese literati and scholars, facing that cold bright moon, have had so many similar sighs and seekings. Li Bai "raising cup to invite the bright moon" invites not only the fairy in the moon palace but also the desire in his heart to transcend the mundane and understand the mysteries of the universe; Su Shi asking "when did the bright moon first exist, raising wine to question the blue sky" questions not only the rhythm of the moon's phases but also the philosophical reflection on life's gatherings and separations, the smallness of individuals, and the eternity of time and space. **What they sought was not the physical moon itself, but the spiritual realm of clarity, perfection, and transcendence symbolized by moonlight, that ultimate concern for life's meaning and cosmic truth.** The moon, through the pursuit of countless scholars and poets throughout history, has become an eternal image in Chinese culture, carrying endless reveries and emotions.

Isn't today's pursuit of AGI and perfect embodied intelligence a modern technological version of "questioning the moon"? What we long to create is not just a powerful tool but an "intelligent mirror" that can understand the world and even ourselves. **What we pursue is precisely that "perfection of intelligence" emerging from the perfect harmony of morphology, action, perception, and learning.** The driving force behind this pursuit is deeply rooted in humanity's instinct to explore the unknown and transcend self-limitations. Although that "perfect" intelligent "bright moon" may be like the immortal realm in ancient writings, "only in this mountain, too deep in clouds to know its location"—its true form, path to achievement, and even possibility still shrouded in mist—**embodied intelligence and pure "brain" intelligence are not mutually exclusive; they need to complement each other and develop together**—this doesn't mean the process of seeking loses its value. **Perhaps the embodied path is the necessary route to true artificial general intelligence, as it forces intelligence to face the real constraints and richness of the physical world**.

Just as ancient poets didn't stop their verses because they couldn't truly "hold the moon," they instead created immortal poetry through gazing at, contemplating, and depicting moonlight, expressing deep emotions and reflecting the rich layers of the human spirit. Similarly, if that ultimately "perfect" intelligent "bright moon" hasn't come yet, isn't every refinement of algorithms, every breakthrough in hardware, every innovation in human-machine interaction modes, even every profound reflection on technical ethical boundaries along our journey of exploring embodied intelligence, writing a "technological poetry" belonging to our era? These "imperfect" achievements, these "streetlights" and "camellias" along the way, may be just scattered reflections or faint echoes of the "moon," yet they tangibly expand cognitive boundaries, solve real problems, and continuously inspire deeper thinking about the nature of "intelligence." This seeking itself, this posture of continuously pursuing and approaching ideals within imperfection, is itself an existence full of power and poetry, itself worthy of our experience and cherishing. Not quite full, not quite empty—perhaps this is the most charming and authentic footnote to this journey of exploration, suggesting that infinite scenery and possibilities still await our discovery and creation.

The evolution of intelligence may be like the tides, with its own rhythm between fullness and waning. If that bright moon representing ultimate wisdom, like the unobtainable beauty in ancient verses, hasn't fully illuminated the human world, then this seeking itself, this thinking and creation along the way, can also reflect the clear shadow of wisdom, comforting that original seeking heart.

# **Moonlight Not Yet Arrived, Lamps Can Still Start Wildfires, and Reflect the Original Heart**

"If the moon hasn't come yet, streetlights can still illuminate the windowsill, shining on the white camellia as it slowly blooms..." Those machine figures running, swaying, and even falling on the Yizhuang track embody countless "streetlights" in the current field of embodied intelligence striving to shine. That bright "moon" symbolizing the ultimate "true intelligence," like the full moon that has drawn the gaze of Eastern sages for thousands of years, may need long years before its light fully covers the earth.

But before its glorious rise, we need not wait in darkness. The "lights" before us, though varied in form and uneven in brightness—some are "practical lights" already working stably in specific industries, some are "demonstration lights" provoking discussion, requiring us to carefully discern their "bubbles" and "illusions," some are "thought lights" burning quietly in laboratories, papers, and code repositories, pushing cognitive boundaries, and others are "ecosystem lights" and "hardware lights" supporting it all. They may not be "perfect," sometimes appearing weak or flickering, with an insurmountable distance from the ideal "moonlight," but together they form the true canvas of current embodied intelligence exploration, illuminating this civilization journey full of unknowns, challenges, and infinite hope in their own indispensable ways, accumulating enough power to "start wildfires."

Facing this strategic technological transformation that deeply shapes the future, we need a sentiment that both gazes at the stars and keeps feet on the ground, a wisdom that embraces innovation yet proceeds cautiously. We need to understand the twists and length of its development trajectory, insight into the complex motivations behind its bubbles and illusions, appreciate the real value contained in the scenery along the way, and with a long-term perspective, patiently nurture the innovation ecosystem on which it depends to grow. More importantly, **we must always place technological exploration within a framework of humanistic care, considering how it better serves and empowers people rather than alienating them, not forgetting that "original heart" of exploring intelligence and understanding ourselves.**

If the "true intelligence" bright moon has not arrived, let us maintain that ultimate longing for light, while focusing more on cherishing, understanding, and illuminating each "lamp" around and beneath us. In clear recognition of reality, patient protection of the process, and prudent shaping of the future, let us gather wisdom and steadfastly move forward. For it is this power generated and converged from countless faint lights that will eventually penetrate the fog of night and illuminate the vast realm of the intelligent era. And what blooms quietly along the way will not just be technological camellias, but also the deep and moving spiritual landscape reflected by human wisdom in the eternal pursuit of "perfection"—the gentle yet firm strokes we write in this new chapter of understanding ourselves and the universe.
