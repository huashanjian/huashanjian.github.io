# 📚 Educational Resources & Materials

Welcome to my collection of educational materials! Here you'll find slides, tutorials, and resources I've created to share knowledge and insights in AI, Computer Science, and related fields.

## 🌍 World Models & AI

I warmly welcome you to explore my research interests and directions. As a learner venturing into the field of Embodied Intelligence, I'm deeply fascinated by the concept of world models—not only as a cutting-edge AI technology, but as a profound philosophical inquiry into the nature of intelligence itself.

I've prepared some thoughts and materials about world models specifically for non-specialists, hoping to share this fascinating field in an accessible way and offer you fresh perspectives. Whether you're an AI beginner, an interdisciplinary researcher, or simply someone curious about intelligence, I hope these resources will inspire your thinking and spark meaningful conversations.
