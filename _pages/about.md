<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi there! I'm Junhua Yao, a passionate and curious learner based in the dynamic city of Guangzhou. Currently a freshman pursuing my undergraduate degree, I'm thrilled to be exploring the fascinating world of Computer Science.

I have a budding interest in cutting-edge technologies like Generative AI and Embodied AI, and while I'm just starting my academic journey, I'm eager to dive into research and deepen my understanding of these exciting fields.

Right now, I'm sharpening my skills with tools and languages like PyTorch, C++, Python, LaTeX, and Git. It's been a rewarding challenge, and I'm enjoying every step of the process. I'm also familiar with tools like Zotero for managing research papers and references‚Äîsmall wins that make the learning journey smoother!

Outside of academics, I'm all about staying active and exploring the world. Whether it's playing badminton, swimming, or planning my next travel adventure, I love discovering new places and experiencing different cultures. Traveling is a particular passion of mine, as it allows me to broaden my horizons and embrace the beauty of diversity.

I'd love to connect! Feel free to reach out at junhuayao41@gmail.com if you'd like to chat about shared interests, potential collaborations, or just to say hi.

### Research Interest: Embodied Intelligence
As a beginner in Computer Science, I am deeply fascinated by the field of Embodied Intelligence. This area emphasizes that intelligent systems should develop cognitive capabilities through interaction with the physical world, an idea that greatly inspires me. Through reading relevant literature and engaging in academic discussions, I am gradually building my understanding of this field. I believe that research in embodied intelligence can not only help us develop more natural AI systems but also deepen our understanding of human cognition itself.

My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

# üìù Publications 

As a freshman in Computer Science, I am currently focusing on building a solid foundation in my field. While I don't have any publications yet, I am passionate about conducting meaningful research that can make a real impact.

I believe in the importance of thorough understanding and careful exploration before rushing into publications. My goal is to eventually contribute solid work that advances our understanding of embodied intelligence and brings genuine value to the research community.
